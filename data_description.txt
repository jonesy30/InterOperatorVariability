DATASET DESCRIPTION
Note: all of this has been taken from a paper which outlines this standard benchmarking test.
I won't disclose the paper here for fear of skewing the results of the study, but this has been disclosed in the README

POPULATION DESCRIPTION
Data is 21,139 records of ICU stays in the MIMIC-III dataset, where each record is the first 48 hours of an ICU stay.
One ICU stay per patient. Exclusions:
    - ICU transfers
    - Patients under 18 years old
    - ICU stays lasting under 48 hours
Mortality rate in population = 13.26%

VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
Variables included:
    "Capillary refill rate",
    "Diastolic blood pressure",
    "Fraction inspired oxygen",
    "Glascow coma scale eye opening",
    "Glascow coma scale motor response",
    "Glascow coma scale total",
    "Glascow coma scale verbal response",
    "Glucose",
    "Heart Rate",
    "Height",
    "Mean blood pressure",
    "Oxygen saturation",
    "Respiratory rate",
    "Systolic blood pressure",
    "Temperature",
    "Weight",
    "pH"

PROCESSED DATA 
Each record is a 48 hour snapshot of the 17 variables described above.
    - The 17 variables have been discretized to make 76 columns in each sample
This is stored as a 2D array of size (48 * 76) for each sample
Each sample has been standardized

Train/test/validation split (size):
    - train = 14 681 samples
    - validation = 3222 samples
    - test = 3236 samples
