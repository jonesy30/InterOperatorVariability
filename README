Repository contains code for converting MIMIC-III data into data which can be read in by a machine learning model.
Please note, this code has been written for a Windows machine. Linux or Mac users may need to change directions of \'s in filepaths

REQUIREMENTS
pandas version 0.23.4 -- THIS VERSION SPECIFICALLY
    - earlier and later versions may cause an integer OverFlow exception

TO RUN
run (from command line)
    python process_mimic.py [path_to_mimic_data]
where [path_to_mimic_data] is a filepath to a folder containing the extracted CSV files of the MIMIC-III dataset
NOTE: this process could take up to 7 hours to run

This code will create a folder in the same directory as this README, which will contain 4 folders:
    - root
        - ignore this - these are files used by the process_mimic script. 
        - You can delete if you want to, but if your data gets corrupted, it will save you a lot of time having these already!
    - train
        - Training data
    - test
        - Testing data
    - validation
        - Validation data

TO USE DATA
In Python script:
from data_reader_rewritten import load_data

train_raw = load_data(data_dir, mode='train')

train_data = np.asarray(train_raw[0])
train_labels = np.asarray(train_raw[1])

An example of this can be found in the example_network.py script

OTHER FILES
process_files
    - Scripts which are called from process_mimic.py
support_files
    - Files which are used by process_mimic (normalizer files, test set definitions, etc)
